# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that outlines the step-by-step approach to predicting **customer churn**. The notebook provides structured explanations of the necessary preprocessing and analysis steps, though the actual code implementation is left for users to complete.

## ðŸ“Œ Table of Contents

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
2. **Target Variable Analysis**
3. **Visual Analysis**
4. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
5. **Feature Engineering**
6. **Model Selection and Training**
7. **Evaluation and Interpretation**

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The notebook assumes a dataset containing customer information and a `Churn` column (Yes/No) as the target variable. Example data sources include telecom, banking, or subscription-based businesses.

## ðŸ”§ Steps Covered

* Loading data using `pandas`
* Checking data dimensions and column names
* Examining the distribution of churned vs. retained customers
* Visualizing data trends using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
* Handling missing values and irrelevant features
* Encoding categorical variables for model training

## âš¡ Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/churn-prediction.git
cd churn-prediction
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook task4.ipynb
```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook and implement the code snippets accordingly.

## ðŸš€ Model Training

Once preprocessing is complete, you can experiment with machine learning models such as:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
* Neural Networks

## ðŸ“¢ Contributions

Feel free to contribute by adding implementations for each step, improving data visualizations, or experimenting with different models!
